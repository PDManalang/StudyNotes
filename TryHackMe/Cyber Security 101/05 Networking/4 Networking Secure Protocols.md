# 4 Networking Secure Protocols

## 4.2 TLS
- `Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)`
- `Transport Layer Security (TLS)`
    - a cryptographic protocol operating at OSI model's `transport layer`.
    - allows secure (confidentiality and integrity) communication between a client and server over a insecure network.
    - ensures that no once can read or modify the exchanged data.
- To get a `TLS Certificate`, the server admin will create a `Certificate Signing Request (CSR)` and submits to a `Certificate Authority (CA)`.
