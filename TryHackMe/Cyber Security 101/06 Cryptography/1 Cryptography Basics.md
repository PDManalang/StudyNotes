# 1 Cryptography Basics

## 1.2 Importance of Crytogprahy
- ultimate purpose is to `secure communication in the presence of adversaries`
- can be defined as the `practice and study of techniques for secure communication and data protection` where we expect the presence of adversaries and third-parties

## 1.3 Plaintext to Ciphertext
- `Plaintext`: the original, readable message or data before it's encrypted
- `Ciphertext`: the scrambled, unreadable version of the message after encryption
- `Cipher`: an algorithm or method to convert plaintext into ciphertext and vv. Usually developed by a Mathematician
- `Key`: string of bits the cipher uses to encrypt or decrypt data.
- `Encryption`: the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext using a cipher and a key
- `Decryption`: the reverse process of encryption, converting ciphertext back into plaintext using a cipher and a key

## 1.4 Historical Ciphers
- Cryptography history started back to ancient Egypt in 1900 BCE
- Simplest historical cipher is the `Caesar Cipher`. The idea is simple: `shift each letter by a certain number to encrypt the message`
