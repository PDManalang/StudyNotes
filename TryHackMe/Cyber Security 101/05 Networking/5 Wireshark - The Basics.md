- Wireshark Use Cases:
    - detecting and troubleshooting network problems, such as network load failure points and congestion.
    - detecting security anomalies, such as rogue hosts, abnormal port usage, and suspicious traffic.
    - investigating and learning protocol details, such as response codes and payload data.
- Note: Wireshark is not an `Intrusion Detection System (IDS)`. It only discover and investigate packets in-depth.

## 5.3 Packet Dissection
- also known as `protocol dissection`, which investigates packet details by decoding available protocols and fields.
